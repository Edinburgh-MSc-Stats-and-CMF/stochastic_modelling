\section{Vector Spaces}\cite{author2024book}

A \textbf{vector space} is a collection of objects called vectors, which can be added together and multiplied by scalars, satisfying the following properties:

\begin{definition}
A vector space over a field $\mathbb{F}$ is a set $V$ together with two operations:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Vector addition: $+: V \times V \to V$
    \item Scalar multiplication: $\cdot: \mathbb{F} \times V \to V$
\end{itemize}
\end{definition}

\subsection{Examples of Vector Spaces}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item $\mathbb{R}^n$: The set of all $n$-tuples of real numbers is a vector space.
    \item $P_n$: The set of polynomials of degree at most $n$.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Theorems and Proofs}

\begin{theorem}[Basis Theorem]
Every vector space has a basis, and all bases of a finite-dimensional vector space have the same number of elements, called the dimension of the vector space.
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
Proof goes here...
